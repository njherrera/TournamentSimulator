# TournamentSimulator
 Software for simulating single and double-elimination using Elo-based prediction algorithm. The purpose of the project is for the user to create a fictional tournament by supplying a player's name and Elo score, then generate a bracket and simulate it. Loading players in from an Excel spreadsheet is supported, provided that the spreadsheet is formatted the same way as the "seeds" page of a tournament on UltimateTennisStatistics.com. There is also support for loading in players by way of a match history Excel document, which is just a spreadsheet with 3 columns: player 1, player 2, and the winner of the match between player 1 and player 2. The program calculates the Elo of the players in the match history based on their records.
 
 The program currently simulates matches strictly by comparing the Elo scores of two players, although support for modifiers such as home-field advantage, character matchups in fighting games, etc. is planned, and so is simulating round-by-round.
